### IDEA
- For personal use, wanted to have a handy script which takes a repo name, the branch name and launches a *DEVCONTAINER* on my local system using that, so that i can outright start developing on that repo.
- Also, if that repo already has a `devcontainer.json` and has IDE preferences, required system level libraries, other necessities required to develop on that repo, then i should be able to have my development
environment ready in one click.
- Even if, repo doesn't contain `devcontainer.json`, then generate a basic working devcontainer file.

- And then finally, open the devcontainer in a VSCode window


## How to run
- `bash launch_code_in_devcontainer.sh <repo_name> <branch_name>`
